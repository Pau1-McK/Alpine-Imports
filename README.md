E-commerce Website Development with CRUD, Cart System, and SQL Database

During my second year of studies, I participated in a collaborative web development project that required meticulous adherence to a detailed set of requirements. The primary objective was to create a fully functional e-commerce website that encompassed essential features such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, an SQL database, a shopping cart system, and transaction history tracking.

Key Project Highlights:

Team Collaboration: This project was a collaborative effort, which provided me with valuable experience in teamwork and effective communication. I worked closely with my team members to ensure that we met project objectives and deadlines.

Technical Expertise: Together with my team, we effectively developed a comprehensive e-commerce website using PHP, HTML, and CSS, strictly adhering to the specified project guidelines.

Database Management: As outlined in the project requirements, we established and managed an SQL database, ensuring the seamless integration of phpMyAdmin with XAMPP for local hosting.

User-Friendly Experience: The website featured a user-friendly shopping cart system, allowing customers to add and remove items. Upon payment, the system recorded transactions, enabling users to review their transaction history.

User Authentication: In accordance with project specifications, we implemented user authentication with login and registration functionality. Additionally, we integrated a password recovery mechanism for forgotten passwords.

Security Measures: To meet the project's security requirements, we employed session management and implemented robust SQL injection prevention techniques to safeguard the website against potential security threats.

This team project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided me with invaluable experience in working collaboratively, fostering effective communication, and achieving project goals collectively.
